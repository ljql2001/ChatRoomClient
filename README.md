# ChatRoomClient
Simple chatroom client in C++ loosely based on IRC. This project demonstrates the basic use of sockets. This is the client implementation connecting to [Chat-Server](https://github.com/yorickdewid/Chat-Server). Just connect to the server on the specified port and address. By default port 5000 is used. The project was intended to run on Windows. However with minor changes you'd be able to run it on Linux and Unix based systems.
